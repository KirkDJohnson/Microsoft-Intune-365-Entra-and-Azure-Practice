<h2>Lab Overview:</h2>

<p align="center">
After signing up for Microsoft Intune, setting up the domain KJHomeLab, and creating my first account, I was met with the Microsoft 365 Admin center which suprised me. I did not know that much about Intunes or 365 so I just began exploring with the page infront of me for now. <br/>

The first thing under the Home tab which I was already in, was Users, so I thought it would be a good idea to create some users as I thought I might use them later for administration. I created good ol john smith with basic user priviliges and a helpdesk account as every administrator other than global. I then decided to create a few basic users for now.<br/>

I then created a Security Group called Engineering Department and assigned some users to it. I also created a Microsoft 365 group which appears to be a shared email list. I added all the users, set it to private meaning that only those invited or added tot he group could recieve or send emails from it. It seems like a nice tool to have to send out bulk emails to a specific group or even the entire organization.<br/>
