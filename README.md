<h2>Lab Overview:</h2>

<p align="center">
After signing up for Microsoft Intune, setting up the domain KJHomeLab, and creating my first account, I was met with the Microsoft 365 Admin center which suprised me. I did not know that much about Intunes or 365 so I just began exploring with the page infront of me for now. <br/>

The first thing under the Home tab which I was already in, was Users, so I thought it would be a good idea to create some users as I thought I might use them later for administration. I created good ol john smith with basic user priviliges and a helpdesk account as every administrator other than global. I then decided to create a few basic users for now. There is also the ability to delete users as well. If for instance you licensed the user with someting such as Intune, when the user is deleted you will gain the license back.<br/>

I then created a Security Group called Engineering Department and assigned some users to it. I also created a Microsoft 365 group which appears to be a shared email list. I added all the users, set it to private meaning that only those invited or added tot he group could recieve or send emails from it. It seems like a nice tool to have to send out bulk emails to a specific group or even the entire organization.<br/>

<br />
Ferom within 365 Admin Center you can reset user's password or password protected mailboxes similar to Active Directory Users and Computers. When resetting a password there is an option to automatically create a password or the admin can manually create a password if there is a password naming scheme in the organization.<br/>

<br />
Intrestingly, when I chose to create a guest user, it laucned me into Microsoft Azure rather than staying within 365 Admin Center like creating standard user accounts. Moreover, there was considerably more fields to fill out when creating the guest uesr in Azure<br/>
